4. **Handle Data**: Process inputs and return outputs
5. **Deploy**: Make your API accessible to your PowerApp

Here's a simple example of a Python Flask API that Henry might create to calculate ingredient amounts for different batch sizes:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/calculate-batch', methods=['POST'])
def calculate_batch():
    data = request.json
    
    # Extract data from request
    recipe_name = data.get('recipe')
    desired_batch_size = data.get('batchSize')
    standard_batch_size = data.get('standardSize')
    ingredients = data.get('ingredients', [])
    
    # Calculate scaling factor
    scaling_factor = desired_batch_size / standard_batch_size
    
    # Scale each ingredient
    scaled_ingredients = []
    for ingredient in ingredients:
        scaled_ingredients.append({
            'name': ingredient['name'],
            'amount': round(ingredient['amount'] * scaling_factor, 2),
            'unit': ingredient['unit']
        })
    
    # Return the scaled recipe
    return jsonify({
        'recipe': recipe_name,
        'batchSize': desired_batch_size,
        'ingredients': scaled_ingredients
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

[Screen Placeholder: Replit editor showing the above Python Flask API code with annotations explaining key sections]

## TRY IT YOURSELF: DESIGN A SIMPLE POWERAPP WITH ONE CUSTOM ENHANCEMENT

Imagine you want to create a PowerApp for tracking personal or professional projects, with a custom Python script to calculate estimated completion dates based on task progress.

Instructions:

1. **App Concept**: Define the main purpose of your Project Tracker app and its key features.
   (Example: A project management app that allows users to create projects, add tasks with deadlines, track completion status, and automatically estimate overall project completion dates based on current progress.)

2. **Data Structure**: Design a simple data structure with at least two related tables (e.g., Projects and Tasks).
   - Table 1 Example: Projects (ID, Name, Description, Start_Date, Deadline, Completion_Percentage)
   - Table 2 Example: Tasks (ID, Project_ID, Task_Name, Assigned_To, Due_Date, Status)

3. **App Screens**: Sketch the layout for at least three screens your app would need.
   - Screen 1 Example: Project List (Gallery of all projects with completion percentage)
   - Screen 2 Example: Project Details (Tasks, progress, deadlines)
   - Screen 3 Example: Add/Edit Task Form

4. **Custom Enhancement**: Describe a simple Python function that would enhance your app's functionality. What would it do? What inputs would it need? What output would it provide?
   (Example: A function that takes current task completion percentages and their weights, then calculates a weighted overall project completion percentage and an estimated completion date based on current progress rate.)

This exercise will help you apply the concepts of low-code development, data integration, custom enhancements, and user experience design discussed in the session. Good luck!
